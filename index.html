                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Tuttle is a 7-8 year old female tabby cat. She is spayed and declawed. 
                    She's a little chubby but the vet says she's still doing alright! She's 
                    the sweetest cat and she loves to cuddle. She likes people and being pet 
                    by anyone! She loves to be held too, and isn't particular about how you 
                    do it. She's sweet but a little sour--She's talkative and will meow loud and 
                    long until she gets what she wants(or eventually goes back to sleep). She 
                    loves to go out on our screened in patio and will spend all day out there 
                    if I let her. She tries to get outside, but I have to keep her in since 
                    she was declawed. Sometimes I'll let her out to explore for a few minutes 
                    while I closely supervise. She gets excited but never goes more than about 
                    8 feet without sniffing everything.</p>

                <h2>Adoption</h2>
                <p>I adopted Tuttle 5 and a half years ago from a cat rescue in Manhattan, KS. 
                    The rescue was set up inside Petco for adoptions but I had seen her online 
                    before I met her. I thought she was cute and a declawed cat was perfect for 
                    living with roommates. I had never had a cat before so I knew I wanted an adult. 
                    When I met her I knew she was the one for me!</p>

                <h1>Scully</h1>
                <img src="20200709_111219.jpg" alt="Scully napping" width="500" height="600">
                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Scully is a 4 year old female gray cat. She is spayed but still has her claws. 
                    She is gray all over except for one small spot on her shoulder that you can 
                    only see if you look up close. She likes her alone time but will let you know 
                    when it's time to play! Her favorite "toy" is the light that reflects off of 
                    a screen or something shiny and shines on the wall. She likes the lazer too, 
                    but for some reason random light is really her jam. She's sweet and likes to 
                    cuddle if she's in the right mood(usually before bed). She likes to be pet mostly 
                    just on her head, but when she's really into it she'll snarl in a way so that 
                    one long tooth sticks out!

                <h2>Adoption</h2>
                <p>Two years ago my boyfriend and I were thinking about getting another cat. We 
                    thought Tuttle might like a friend, we weren't sure how she would react to 
                    another cat so we decided to wait. One day I was browsing Nextdoor and saw 
                    a tragic post. A woman's mother had died a few months ago and the woman took 
                    in her mother's two cats. The woman had some cats of her own and the landlord  
                    would not let her keep her mother's cats. She had one week or else the 
                    landlord would give her a heavy fine and was threatening eviction. The woman 
                    tried to take the cats to nearby shelters but they didn't have room. The woman 
                    needed to find new homes for the cats or else they would have to be put down. 
                    I couldn't just scroll past that so I reached out.  
                    I didn't feel ready to go from one cat to three, so I said I could only take one. 
                    My boyfriend and I went to meet them and Scully was sweet and cute and close to 
                    Tuttle's age so we picked her. I'm so glad we did! Also, the woman did find 
                    another home for the other cat so it's a happy ending &#60;3
